The Pomodoro Timer

Brief:
    The Pomo timer is based on the Pomodoro Technique, which
suggests that bursts of intense focus (going ham) is more effective
than trying to focus for hours at a time. In this case, focusing for
25 minutes at a time is better than trying to study for hours
on end.
    I've found this techinque to be massively helpful, and the
purpose of the app is to apply that studying method to the Chrome
browser.

...I'm kind of just writing a readme because I dont have one, and
I should have one. Its not like you need an api to work this
thing lol.

Anyways I hope users of the app find it useful!

As of this writing (11/4/14) the app is still needs lots of fixes
thanks to a miserably busy courseload, but I'll resume work on
this as soon as I get a chance.

I really do enjoy working on this, tis a shame I can't at the
moment.
