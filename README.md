<strong> The Pomodoro Timer </strong>

The Pomodoro Timer keeps you on a study schedule of 25 minutes
of focus, and 5 minutes of break.
Studies have shown that unbroken hyper-focus used like this
is massively helpful for your productivity, and I've found it
incredibly useful in my studies.

The Timer displays the amount of time left to go ham (out of each 25 minute
session), as well as the total amount of time left above it.

Here's a basic look at the UI (I'll make it look prettier later) :

            "Logo Title Text 1")

The smaller gray timer tells you how much time is left in your total
study session, and the larger blue timer tells you how much
time there is until your next mini-break.

You can dynamically add time to your study session at any time
with the buttons on the right side; use them to start a new session
or extend your current session.


Anyways I hope users of the app find it useful!

As of this writing (11/4/14) the app is still needs lots of work.
I'm a bit busy at the moment but I'll continue work on this periodically
as I find time.
