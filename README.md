The Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Timer keeps you on a study schedule of 25 minutes
of focus, and 5 minutes of break.
Studies have shown that unbroken hyper-focus used like this 
is massively helpful for your productivity, and I've found it
incredibly useful in my studies.

The Timer displays the amount of time left to go ham (out of each 25 minute
session), as well as the total amount of time left above it.

Anyways I hope users of the app find it useful!

As of this writing (11/4/14) the app is still needs lots of fixes
thanks to a miserably busy courseload, but I'll resume work on
this as soon as I get a chance.

I really do enjoy working on this, tis a shame I can't at the
moment.
